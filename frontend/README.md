# Oncodash frontend documentation

The interface of Oncodash is made with the [Vue.js (v3)](https://vuejs.org/) framework and build with the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) Bundler. It also uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for better typing. The whole package is made on top of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
The source code can be found in the frontend folder at the root of the project:

- dist : The files of the build after running ``npm run build``.
- node_modules : The dependencies of the frontend, installed with ``npm install``.
- src : The actual source code with the Vue components.
- .editorconfig : The [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file code style.
- .node-version : The version of node.js used by this package.
- Dockerfile : The Dockerfile to build the frontend container.
- package-lock.json : The description of the manifest dependencies, written by node.js when dependencies changes. It must not be modified by hand, and must always be commited.
- package.json : The node.js package manifest, containing dependencing and metadata.
- tsconfig.json : The config file of typescript.
- vite.config.ts : The config file of Vite.

## Source code

The main source code of the interface is under `frontend/src/`, organised as such :

- assets : contains the images and icons used by the components.
- components : the list of the Vue components that make the pages.
- models : the classes and custom types representing the interface entities, such as a patient or a sample.
- public : the list of files that [should not be processed by the bundler](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) and just served at the root of the website (e.g. robots.txt).
- api.ts : the list of API endpoints used by the components.
- apiState.ts : a [pinia store](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) managing the state of the api requests.
- globals.css : the global CSS theme for the whole interface.
- index.html : the main html of the application.
- main.ts : the main entry point of the Vue components.
- router.ts : the list of pages and routing logic, handled by [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/).

## Patient timelines

The patient timelines are rendered using [canvajs](https://canvasjs.com/), specifically `@canvasjs/vue-stockcharts` as declared in the package.json.

## Vue components

The Oncodash interface uses the [Vue framework](https://vuejs.org/) the implement the graphical components.
It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative, component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces of any complexity. The components themselves are written as [Single-File Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#single-file-components) (SFC) ending with the `.vue` extension.

## Development

Managing the server is done with the ususal node.js commands, setup in the package.json scripts declarations.

Use the supported npm version:
```sh
nvm use 20.0.0
```

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

    FIXME    
    There is a Sphinx autosummary bug that prevents it to automatically show the details of classes
    that are not explicitely mentionned elsewhere, preventing having here a real full doc.
    See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2701998/sphinx-autodoc-is-not-automatic-enough/62613202#62613202
    and the issue: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/7912
